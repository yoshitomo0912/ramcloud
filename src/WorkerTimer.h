/**
 * This class implements a timer mechanism, which can be used to schedule
 * the execution of code in the future. WorkerTimers are different from the
 * timers provided by Dispatch in that WorkerTimers run in a separate worker
 * thread (whereas Dispatch timers run in the dispatch thread). This makes
 * WorkerTimer less efficient (since each timer event requires the worker
 * thread to wake up), but avoids disrupting the Dispatch thread for timer
 * events that take a long time to process.
 *
 * Each WorkerTimer object represents a single timer; the client implements
 * the handleTimerEvent method, which is called when the timer fires.
 *
 * This class is thread-safe (it can be invoked by competing threads
 * simultaneously).
